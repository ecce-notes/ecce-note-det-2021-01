\section{Summary}
\label{summary}
The re-use of the BaBar solenoid is a cost effective choice for the ECCE magnet.   As an insurance in case problems develop with the magnet during the upcoming sPHENIX running, we will have full design drawings prepared for the purchase of a replacement.   On the other hand, if the magnet continues to perform well, it can simply be re-used. Simulations show that there is no need for a corrector coil to achieve the required dRICH performance.
